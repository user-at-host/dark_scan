# dark_scan
This is a very old project I once worked on. It did not recieve any updates for about 5 years.
Now I decided to reincarnate it, so updates are expected.

This is 100% human code. *No* vibe coding or AI written code.

## About the Project

Dark scan is a port scanner that uses the Tor network to scan targets.  
To connect to the Tor network Dark Scan uses a pre-comiled standalone Tor binary.
There is no need to install/configure anything on the host system.
The connection to Tor network is done automatically without user interaction.<br/>
